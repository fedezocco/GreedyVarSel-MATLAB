The datasets "Sim1" and "Sim2" are generated by "DataGenerator.m". "PitProps.mat" is uploaded on this repository. The datasets "Semiconductor" and "MofERdata" (called "PlasmaEtch" in the source paper) are not public for confidentiality reasons. The remaining datasets are not uploaded on this repository due to memory constraints. The user can download them from the links provided in the source paper.
