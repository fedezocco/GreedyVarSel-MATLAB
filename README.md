# A MATLAB implementation of greedy algorithms for unsupervised variable selection
The repository contains the source code of the paper "Lazy FSCA for Unsupervised Variable Selection" authored by Federico Zocco, Marco Maggipinto, Gian Antonio Susto and Se√°n McLoone. The paper is under review by Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence. A preprint is available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02687.

If you use this code, please consider citing the corresponding paper mentioned above.

The datasets "Sim1" and "Sim2" are generated by "DataGenerator.m". "PitProps.mat" is uploaded on this repository. The datasets "Semiconductor" and "MofERdata" (called "PlasmaEtch" in the source paper) are not public for confidentiality reasons. The remaining datasets are not uploaded on this repository due to memory constraints. The user can download them from the links provided in the source paper.
